# About Me

## Woodie Westbrook

 I have been writing applications since the mid 80s starting out on the venerable Tandy TRS-80. Since then I have worked across many sectors of government and private industry specializing in architecture, web applications, DevOps, and agile development. Currently I am the Director of IT & Development at BlueStar Retirement Services. I am a US Army veteran, college drop-out, American Mensa member, and brutal pragmatist with a lack of self-preservation instincts and a propensity for injury. I love good science fiction, craft beer, and going really fast on anything with two wheels. When not working I enjoy Nerf gun wars with my son, movie night with my wife, long walks with my Doberman, and off-road motorcycle racing.
